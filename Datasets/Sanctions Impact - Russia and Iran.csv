Trump signed a National Security Presidential Memorandum (NSPM) restoring maximum pressure on the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, denying Iran all paths to a nuclear weapon, and countering Iran’s malign influence abroad.

The NSPM establishes that:
Iran should be denied a nuclear weapon and intercontinental ballistic missiles;
Iran’s terrorist network should be neutralized; and
Iran’s aggressive development of missiles, as well as other asymmetric and conventional weapons capabilities, should be countered.
The NSPM directs the Secretary of the Treasury to impose maximum economic pressure on the Government of Iran, including by sanctioning or imposing enforcement mechanisms on those acting in violation of existing sanctions.
The Treasury Secretary will also issue guidance for all relevant business sectors – including shipping, insurance, and port operators – about the risks to any person that knowingly violates U.S. sanctions with respect to Iran or an Iranian terror proxy.
The Secretary of State will also modify or rescind existing sanctions waivers and cooperate with the Secretary of Treasury to implement a campaign aimed at driving Iran’s oil exports to zero.
The United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations will work with key allies to complete the snapback of international sanctions and restrictions on Iran.
PROTECTING THE HOMELAND FROM IRAN: The previous Administration’s tolerance of Iran’s threats to American citizens and companies ends now.

The Attorney General will pursue all available legal steps to investigate, disrupt, and prosecute financial and logistical networks, operatives, or front groups inside the United States that are sponsored by Iran or an Iranian terror proxy.
The Attorney General will prosecute leaders and members of Iranian-funded terrorist groups that have captured, harmed, or killed American citizens and seek their arrest and extradition to the United States.
TAKING IRAN’S NUCLEAR PROGRAM OFF THE TABLE: President Trump will not tolerate Iran possessing a nuclear weapons capability, nor will he stand for their sustained sponsorship of terrorism, especially against U.S. interests.

In 2020, President Trump declared that “as long as [he is] President of the United States, Iran will never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon.”
Today’s NSPM fulfills the President’s 2020 vow to contend with Iran’s pernicious influence across the globe:
“For far too long — all the way back to 1979, to be exact — nations have tolerated Iran’s destructive and destabilizing behavior in the Middle East and beyond.  Those days are over.  Iran has been the leading sponsor of terrorism, and their pursuit of nuclear weapons threatens the civilized world.  We will never let that happen.”"

This network is being designated for facilitating millions of barrels of illicit Iranian oil shipments to China to fund Iran’s Armed Forces General Staff through its front company Sepehr Energy.  Proceeds of these sales support terrorist and proxy groups.

In addition, the United States is targeting shadow fleet vessels and management companies that transported Iranian oil, aiding Iran’s ability to promote destabilizing activities in the region.

We will disrupt illicit funding streams financing Iran’s armed forces and terrorist groups, such as Hamas and Hizballah.  We will use all tools at our disposal to hold the regime accountable for its destabilizing activities and pursuit of nuclear weapons that threaten the civilized world.

Today’s action is being taken pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13224, as amended, the counterterrorism sanctions authority, and E.O. 13902, which provides authority to the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to identify and impose sanctions on key sectors of Iran’s economy.

The United States will use all available means to expose and disrupt Iran’s growing UAV and missile development and proliferation, which destabilizes the Middle East and beyond. We will continue to act against the complex schemes Iran employs to conceal its acquisition of sensitive technology for its missile and UAV programs. These programs produce missiles and drones that Iran uses against our allies and exports to its terror proxy groups and Russia.

Iran’s illicit oil trade fuels these destabilizing activities. Its oil exports are enabled by a network of shipping facilitators in multiple jurisdictions who, through obfuscation and deception, load and transport Iranian oil for sale to buyers in Asia. Iran’s MINISTRY OF PETROLEUM, NATIONAL IRANIAN OIL COMPANY, and NATIONAL IRANIAN TANKER COMPANY, U.S.-designated entities, rely significantly on ship-to-ship (STS) transfers and associated third-country service providers to optimize the efficiency of their tanker fleet. These STS transfers, frequently conducted while one or more vessels have disabled or manipulated their automatic identification system (AIS), also serve to disguise the Iranian origin of the cargo.

Today, the United States is acting under President Trump’s policy of maximum pressure  on the Iranian regime to stop the flow of revenue it uses to fund these destabilizing activities.  The Department of State is imposing sanctions on three entities engaged in the Iranian petroleum trade and is identifying three vessels as blocked property.  These targets are being designated pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13846, which authorizes and reimposes certain sanctions with respect to Iran.

Specifically, the Department of State is targeting maritime service providers that have facilitated the STS transfer of Iranian crude oil between U.S.-designated STAR FOREST (IMO 9237632) and SOBAR (IMO 9221970) on December 25, 2024, near Nipa, Indonesia. Today, we seek to degrade Iran’s STS operations and to highlight the risks associated with facilitating Iran’s crude oil trade.

The Department is designating the following entity pursuant to section 3(a)(ii) of E.O. 13846 for knowingly engaging in a significant transaction for the purchase, acquisition, sale, transport, or marketing of petroleum or petroleum products from Iran:"

These entities provide services to the ghost fleet vessels conducting ship-to-ship (STS) transfer operations outside port limits in Southeast Asia, and enabling Iran’s attempts to disguise its illicit oil trade. 

The Department of the Treasury is concurrently designating Iran’s Minister of Petroleum Mohsen Paknejad and several entities transporting Iranian oil to China, and will identify their vessels as blocked property.  The Iranian regime and its military are stealing the nation’s oil wealth with the help of Mohsen Paknejad, the head of Iran’s Oil Ministry. 

Today’s action advances President Trump’s policy of maximum pressure on the Iranian regime, which is designed to end Iran’s nuclear threat, curtail its ballistic missile program, and stop it from supporting or rebuilding its terrorist proxy groups, including by driving Iran’s oil exports to zero — especially oil exports to China. 

We will continue to disrupt illicit funding to curb malign activities, limit the financial resources available to corrupt officials, and use all the tools at our disposal to hold the regime accountable. 

Today’s State Department action is being taken pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13846, which targets transactions involving petroleum from Iran.  Today’s Treasury Department action is being taken pursuant to E.O. 13902, which targets Iran’s petroleum and petrochemical sectors.

The Department of the Treasury is concurrently sanctioning China-based Shandong Shouguang Luqing Petrochemical Co., Ltd., a “teapot” oil refinery, for purchasing and refining hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of Iranian crude oil.  This includes oil from vessels linked to Ansarallah (Houthis), a Foreign Terrorist Organization, and the U.S.-designated Iranian Ministry of Defense of Armed Forces Logistics (MODAFL).  “Teapot” refiners are private Chinese refineries that are the primary purchasers of Iranian oil.  This will be the United States’ first designation of a teapot refinery.

In addition, the Department of the Treasury is sanctioning 12 entities and one individual, and identifying eight vessels as blocked property for being responsible for shipping millions of barrels of Iranian oil to China.  These vessels—are part of Iran’s “shadow fleet” of tankers that supply teapot refineries, including Luqing Petrochemical.

These sanctions are being imposed pursuant to President Trump’s maximum pressure campaign to drive Iran’s oil exports, including to China, to zero.  China is by far the largest importer of Iranian oil. The Iranian regime uses the revenue it generates from these sales to finance attacks on U.S. allies, support terrorism around the world, and pursue other destabilizing actions.

All these new sanctions will be fully enforced under the Trump Administration’s maximum pressure campaign.  So long as Iran attempts to generate oil revenues to fund its destabilizing activities, the United States will hold both Iran and all its sanctions-evading partners accountable.

Today’s action by the Department of State is being taken pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13846, which authorizes and reimposes certain sanctions with respect to Iran.  Today’s action by the Department of the Treasury is being taken pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13902, which target Iran’s petroleum and petrochemical sectors.

These sanctions will curtail the flow of revenue the Iranian regime uses to finance its destabilizing activities and are part of President Trump’s commitment to drive Iran’s export of oil to zero — especially oil exports to China.

We will continue to curb illicit funding that funds Iran’s malign activities, limit the financial resources available to corrupt regime officials, and use all the tools at our disposal to hold the regime accountable.

Today’s actions are being taken pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13846, which authorizes and reimposes certain sanctions with respect to Iran, and Executive Order (E.O.) 13902, which targets Iran’s petroleum and petrochemical sectors, and marks the fifth round of sanctions targeting Iranian oil sales since the President issued National Security Presidential Memorandum 2  on February 4, 2025, ordering a campaign of maximum pressure on Iran.

This revenue funds Iran’s malign behavior, particularly the regime’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs and its support for terrorist proxies.

Iranian companies continually adapt their networks to evade sanctions and sell to foreign customers.  The United States is committed to sanctioning Iranian firms that fund the regime’s destabilizing conduct.

The Trump Administration will vigorously enforce all U.S. sanctions on Iran as part of its maximum pressure campaign.  So long as Iran attempts to generate oil revenues to fund its subversive activities, the United States will hold accountable both Iran and all its partners in sanctions evasion.

Today’s action is being taken pursuant to President Trump’s maximum pressure campaign and E.O. 13902, which targets those operating in certain sectors of the Iranian economy.  On October 11, 2024, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, determined that section 1(a)(i) of E.O. 13902 shall apply to the petroleum and petrochemical sectors of the Iranian economy, which allows Treasury to target a broader range of activities relating to Iran’s trade in petroleum and petrochemical products.

Today, the United States is taking action to stem the flow of revenue that the regime uses to fund these destabilizing activities. The Department of State is imposing sanctions on seven entities engaged in Iranian petroleum products and petrochemical products trade and is identifying two vessels as blocked property.

This action includes the designation of four sellers of Iranian petrochemicals and one purchaser who have generated hundreds of millions of dollars in illicit funds for Iran’s destabilizing activities. These companies send Iranian-origin petrochemicals and petrochemical products to third party countries and enable Iran to evade sanctions and continue to generate revenue.

The Department of State is also sanctioning one marine management company for transporting Iranian petroleum products. Two vessels managed by this company are also being identified as blocked property. Iran’s energy exports are enabled by a network of such illicit shipping facilitators in multiple jurisdictions who, through obfuscation and deception, load and transport Iranian petroleum products for sale to buyers in Asia.

The Department of State is additionally sanctioning an Iran-based cargo inspection company. Such companies are hired by buyers and shippers of cargo as third-party actors to ensure and certify that a purchased cargo is properly loaded onto the vessel transporting it. By doing so, they reduce the risk these sanctions violators face, thereby playing an important role in the supply chains for illicit Iranian energy products."

The Department of the Treasury is sanctioning two Sudanese Islamist actors – Gebreil Ibrahim Mohamed Fediel (Gebreil) and the Al-Baraa Bin Malik Brigade (BBMB) – pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 14098, “Imposing Sanctions on Certain Persons Destabilizing Sudan and Undermining the Goal of a Democratic Transition,” for their role in Sudan’s brutal war.

Today’s sanctions seek to limit Islamist influence in Sudan and curtail Iran’s regional activities that have contributed to regional destabilization, conflict, and civilian suffering. Sudanese Islamist elements have a long history as a malign force in Sudan, most notably during the Islamist regime of former President Omar al-Bashir, who ruled Sudan for 30 years until 2019. Recently, Sudanese Islamists have played a key role in derailing Sudan’s progress toward a democratic transition, by undermining the former civilian-led transitional government and the Framework Political Agreement process. This conduct contributed to the outbreak of fighting between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces in April 2023. Hardline Islamists continue to obstruct efforts to reach a ceasefire to end the war and are cultivating ties with and receiving technical support from the Iranian government, particularly the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization.

These sanctions hold malign actors accountable for sowing instability and destruction in Sudan with the help of Iran. The United States is committed to working with regional partners to achieve peace and stability in Sudan and ensuring the country does not become a permissive environment for those who threaten Americans and national interests of the United States. The U.S. government will use its tools to ensure that Sudanese Islamists never regain power in Sudan.

The Department of the Treasury’s actions were taken pursuant to E.O. 14098, which authorizes the imposition of sanctions on persons who are responsible for, or complicit in, or have directly or indirectly engaged or attempted to engage in actions or policies that threaten the peace, security, or stability of Sudan or who are or have been a leader, official, senior executive officer, or member of the board of directors of any entity that has, or whose members have, engaged in such actions or policies relating to the tenure of such leader, official, senior executive officer, or member of the board of directors.  For more information, see the Department of the Treasury’s Press Releases.  "

We are sanctioning approximately 40 individuals, entities, and vessels involved in the trade of Iranian energy products that generates hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue for the Iranian regime.  These designations include some of the largest buyers of Iranian petrochemical products by volume and value, as well as the leadership of the companies involved in that trade.  The Department is also designating a China-based liquid petrochemical products terminal and multiple shadow fleet operators and vessels.  

Concurrently, the Department of the Treasury is sanctioning over 50 individuals, entities, and vessels involved in exporting Iranian petroleum and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to global markets.  Treasury is designating a network of actors that facilitate hundreds of millions of dollars in LPG shipments, a China-based crude oil terminal, and a Chinese refinery purchasing Iranian oil.  These actions aim to disrupt funding for Iran’s regime and its military activities that threaten the United States and regional allies. 

The Trump Administration continues to vigorously implement and enforce all U.S. sanctions on Iran as part of its maximum pressure campaign.  So long as Iran attempts to generate oil revenues to fund its subversive activities, the United States will act to counter and to promote accountability for Iran and its partners in sanctions evasion.   

Today’s actions are being taken pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13902, which targets those operating in certain sectors of the Iranian economy, as well as E.O. 13846, which targets Iran’s petroleum and petrochemical sectors.  This action further targets Iranian oil sales in support of the President’s National Security Presidential Memorandum 2 (NSPM-2).  This is the fourth sanctions action of this administration targeting China-based refineries that receive Iranian oil, and it builds on actions in July and August targeting key enablers of Iran’s oil exports.  For more information, please see Treasury’s Press Releases and State’s Fact Sheet."

The Iranian regime continues to fuel conflict in the Middle East to fund its destabilizing activities.  This behavior enables Iran to fund its nuclear escalations, support terrorist groups, and disrupt the flow of trade and freedom of navigation in waterways that are crucial to global prosperity and economic growth.  The United States will continue to act against the network of maritime service providers, dark fleet operators, and petroleum products traders involved in the transport of Iranian crude oil and petroleum products.

This action further constrains Iran’s ability to export petroleum and petroleum products through obscure and fraudulent mechanisms.

The United States will continue pursuing measures to implement National Security Presidential Memorandum 2, which directs the imposition of maximum pressure on the Iranian regime to deprive it of the revenues that fund its destabilizing activities. We will not hesitate to utilize all available tools at our disposal to counter those who enable Iran’s illicit oil trade.

Today’s action is being taken pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13902, which target Iran’s petroleum and petrochemical sectors.

The Department of the Treasury has imposed sanctions on eight entities and nine vessels in Iran regime’s shadow fleet. These entities have shipped hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of Iranian petroleum and petroleum products, including liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), helping finance the regime and its security forces.

As the Iranian people protest the Iranian regime’s catastrophic economic mismanagement, the regime continues to fund foreign proxies and missiles over the basic needs of Iranians. Massive inflation, crumbling infrastructure, and water and electricity shortages demonstrate that Iranians are not seeing their wealth put to good use: the Iranian regime refuses to put Iranians first.

This latest action will further restrict Iran’s ability to export petroleum and petroleum products through obscure and fraudulent mechanisms, and will further constrain its ability to bankroll the repression of Iranians and international malign behavior.

The United States will continue to implement National Security Presidential Memorandum 2, which directs the imposition of maximum pressure on the Iranian regime to deprive it of revenues that fund its destabilizing activities.

As the Iranian people protest 47 years of catastrophic economic mismanagement, the regime continues to choose funding terrorist militias abroad and its vast weapons programs over the basic needs of everyday Iranians.  The people of Iran suffer from rising inflation, crumbling infrastructure, and shortages of water and electricity because the regime is squandering their wealth on its malign activities.

The United States supports the Iranian people in their protests against the corrupt and repressive regime in Tehran. We are designating six Iranian officials who oversee the Iranian security forces responsible for the violent crackdowns on protesters, as well as an Iranian investor who embezzled billions in funds from the Iranian people.
